        <li>
          Now that we have an idea of a basic text-editor, we will download and
          install a widely used editor called Visual Studio Code Editor
          <br /><br />
          <!-- Download Visual Studio Code -->

          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Once your software downloads, click to unzip and drag it to your
          Applications folder, making it easier to find in your launchpad
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/vscodeapp.png" alt="vscodeapp.png" />

        </li>
        <!-- Install Extensions to VS Code -->
        <li>
          Now that we have installed the main code editor we will be utilizing
          throughout class, now we're going to install a few extensions that we
          will need for viewing the live renders of our code
          <br><br>
          <img src="assets/imgs/vsinterface.png" alt="vsinterface.png" srcset="">
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          First, navigate to the left side panel in Visual Studio Code and click
          the icon with the four boxes <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/extensionssearch.png" alt="extensionssearch.png" />
          <br /><br />
          In the Extensions tab, click in the search bar at the top. Then in the
          search bar, type "live preview". The extension Live Preview by
          Microsoft should be one of the first in the list. Click the Install
          button to install the extension
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/livepreview.png" alt="livepreview.png" />

            code within Visual Studio.</em
          >
          <br /><br />
          In the Extensions tab, click in the search bar at the top. Then in the
          search bar, type "live server". The extension Live Server by Ritwick
          Dey should be one of the first in the list. Click the Install button
          to install the extension<br />

            Now that we have create our Github download and install GitHub
            Desktop from the following site:
            <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

        </li>
        <li>
          After installation, log in using your new GitHub account. It will take
          you briefly back to the browser to confirm your identify; click
          "Allow" when prompted. You should see some pages in the app like the
          following: <br /><br />

            alt="githubdesktopsignin.png"

          <br /><br />
          Here's the page you will see when it redirects you to Github to
          authenticate yourself.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/authorization.png" alt="authorization" />

        </li>
        <li>
          After you've successfully logged in to GitHub Desktop, we are going to

          <strong

        <li>
          Select the Repository we just created earlier on Github.com, and
          select the folder on your Desktop you just created (you may need to
          add <em>your_username</em>.github.io to the file path afterwards if it
          doesn't auto-populate it; see the screenshot below).<br /><br />

            alt="clonerepo2.png"
          /><br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          After clicking "Clone", Github Desktop will download your repository
          from the web.&nbsp; After the download, you should see a new folder
          named after your repository, with a readme file inside it. This means
          you successfully cloned your repository! <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Make sure you pay attention to the local path where your project is

    <!-- Part 4 Instructions -->
    <section>
      <ol>
        <li>Now that we have somewhere to host our projects, we will move an already finished project (Hello World) and our Code Skeleton into our Github repository
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/helloworld.png" alt="helloworld.png">
                <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Now that you have your Github repository opened in your code editor, we will now drag both folders from the desktop into our sidebar on the left
          <br><br>
          <img src="assets/imgs/skeletonvscode.png" alt="skeletonvscode.png">
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Don't forget to save! Blue Circle Indicator with number means files are not save
            <br><br>
            CMD + S to quick save</strong>
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Now, jump back to Github Desktop. In the app, you should see your Hello World and Code Skeleton folders, along with its contents were added as changes or commits.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/revisedindex.png" alt="revisedindex.png" />
          <br /><br />
          We're going to save a copy of your changes in something called a "commit". <strong>A commit is basically a snapshot of the changes you made, which gets added to the repository's source control.</strong> This is useful for many reasons; for example, if you make a breaking change to your website, you can revert back to a previous commit (aka snapshot) to make it work again while you try to figure out what went wrong.
          <br /><br />
          Add a commit name (required) and description (optional) in the textboxes in the bottom left of the app. Then click the "Commit to main" button to create a commit of your changes.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/commit.png" alt="commit.png">
          <br /><br />
          <strong>WARNING: Github cannot handle super large files, and adding files greater than 20 MB could cause Github Desktop to choke; it is highly recommended to use compressed files on the web anyway, so if you have high resolution image or video files you'd like to use, talk with your instructor first.&nbsp; You will likely make your school life a lot harder otherwise...</strong>
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>Next, we are going to do something called a "push". <strong>A push is an action that, well, <em>pushes</em> your local commits to the remote server on github.com.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          There are two places you start a push in Github Desktop, both circled in the screenshot below. (The term <em>origin&nbsp;</em>refers to the repository on the remote server (github.com) that you cloned your local repository from.)
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Note that each location has an indicator of how many commits you are going to push. That is because it's possible to make multiple commits locally before pushing them.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/pushorigin.png" alt="pushorigin.png" />
          <br /><br />Go ahead and click either option to push your changes to your website.
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>If the push was successful, the top option should change to "Fetch origin".
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/fetchorigin.png" alt="fetchorigin.png" />
          <br /><br />
          For reference:<em>
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Fetching</em> is a command to tell Github Desktop to communicate with the remote server repository to see if anything changed since the last time we fetched.</strong>
            <br /><br />
            If there were any changes (which could happen if you were writing code on multiple computers or with a team of developers who were pushing their own commits), that button would change to "Pull origin", and indicate how many commits that you're missing.
            <br /><br />
            <strong><em>Pulling&nbsp;</em>is the process of downloading/syncing changes from the remote server repository with your own local repository.</strong>
            <br /><br />
         </li>
         <li>Now return to the Github website, and go into the repository you made earlier with github.io at the end of it. Once you navigate to the main repository code screen, you should see your HelloWorld folder that you created in the middle section.
          <br><br>
          <strong>NOTE: Github pages often times takes 5-10 minutes to actually render out your commit, so you may have to wait and then check to see if your site is live </strong>
          <br><br>
            Now you can navigate to the sidebar and click on github pages under "Environments". 
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/githubsidebar.png" alt="githubsidebar.png" />
          <br /><br />
          From there you will find the deployment page (the most recent deployment will usually be at the top). Click on the deployment and it will open your "homepage" of sorts. In order to find your Hello World site (a project nested in your main repository), you must add the project folder name to the end of the URL
          <br /><br />
          For example:
          <br>
          https://gdwd-kc.github.io/kctobias.github.io<strong>/HelloWorld/</strong>
          <br><br>
          <strong>Don't forget the last forward slash!</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="assets/imgs/browser.png" alt="browser.png" />
          <br /><br />
          Within a couple minutes of pushing your code, the url should update to display your brand new "Hello World" homepage! 
          <br><br>
          <strong>Congratulations! You just built your first GitHub Pages site.</strong>
