            <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/</a> and create a GitHub account.
                <img src="assets/imgs/githubhomepage.png" alt="githubhompepage.png">
                <br /><br />
                <strong>NOTE: Your username will be publicly viewable, and will also be included in the URL for your website, so make sure to pick something you're comfortable sharing with the world!</strong>
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Login to your GitHub account. From your home screen, click the green "Create repository" button.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/createrepo.png" alt="createrepo.png" />

            </li>
            <!-- New Repo -->
            <li>Name your new repository:<em>your_username</em>.github.io (replacing&nbsp;<em>your_username&nbsp;</em>with your actual username, of course)
                <br /><br />
               <strong>NOTE: This is very important to get right!</strong>

                <br /><br />
                <p>Make sure it is public, and tell GitHub to create a README file as well.&nbsp;Then click the green "Create repository" button.

                <img src="assets/imgs/publicrepo.png" alt="publicrepo.png" /></p>
            </li>
            <li>Now that you've created the repository, we're going to confirm that Github Pages is working correctly.&nbsp; You should be on the repository page after creating it, so click on the "Settings" tab in the navigation near the top.

    <section>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If you haven't already, download and install GitHub Desktop from the following site: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://desktop.github.com/</a></p>
                <img src="assets/imgs/githubdesktop.png" alt="githubdesktop.png">
            </li>
            <li>After installation, log in using your new GitHub account. It will take you briefly back to the browser to confirm your identify; click "Allow" when prompted. You should see some pages in the app like the following:
                <img src="assets/imgs/githubdesktopsignin.png" alt="githubdesktopsignin.png"/> 
                <br /><br />
                Here's the page you will see when it redirects you to Github to authenticate yourself.
                <br /><br />
              <img src="assets/imgs/authorization.png" alt="authorization" /><br /><br />On the Configure Git, select the "Use my Github account name and email address".<br />
              <img src="assets/imgs/configuregit.png" alt="clonerepo.png"  /><br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>After you've successfully logged in to GitHub Desktop, we are going to "clone" your remote repository to your local machine.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>What this means is, we are going to pull down and create a copy of the repository from Github.com (the remote location) to your Desktop (the local location).</strong>
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Create a new folder on your desktop called "GitHub".</li>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="assets/imgs/githubfolder.png" alt="githubfolder.png" >
            <li>In GitHub Desktop, click the "Clone a Repository from the Internet" button.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/clonerepo.png" alt="clonerepo.png" />
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Select the Repository we just created earlier on Github.com, and select the folder on your Desktop you just created (you may need to add <em>your_username</em>.github.io to the file path afterwards if it doesn't auto-populate it; see the screenshot below).<br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/clonerepo2.png" alt="clonerepo2.png" /><br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>After clicking "Clone", Github Desktop will download your repository from the web.&nbsp; After the download, you should see a new folder named after your repository, with a readme file inside it. This means you successfully cloned your repository!
                <br> <br>
                Make sure you pay attention to the local path where your project is cloned to so you can always find it on your computer!

        <ol>
            <li>If you haven't already, download and install the Visual Studio Code (found here:
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>)
                <img src="assets/imgs/vscodehome.png" alt="vscodehome.png">
            </li>
            <li>
                Reopen Github Desktop (Your cloned repository should be the current) and Click "Open in Visual Studio" in the middle section
                <img src="assets/imgs/gitvcontrol.png" alt="gitvcontrol.png">
            </li>
            <!-- Download VS Code Extensions -->
            <li>Now we will install a few extensions to be able to view your live code within your code editor
                <br /><br />First, navigate to the left side panel in Visual Studio Code and click the icon with the four boxes.
                <br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/extensionstab.png" alt="extensionstab.png"/>
                <br /><br />
                In the Extensions tab, click in the search bar at the top. Then in the search bar, type "live preview". The extension Live Preview by Microsfoft should be one of the first in the list. Click the Install button to install the extension<br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/livepreview.png" alt="livepreview.png" />
                <br /><br />
                <em>This extension will allow you to preview your HTML/CSS/Javascript code within Visual Studio.</em>
                <br /><br />
                In the Extensions tab, click in the search bar at the top. Then in the search bar, type "live server". The extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey should be one of the first in the list. Click the Install button to install the extension<br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/liveserver.png" alt="liveserver.png" />
                <br /><br />
                <em>This extension will allow you to preview your HTML/CSS/Javascript code within Visual Studio.</em>
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Now find your code skeleton folder that we created earlier and drop the entire folder into your repository in Visual Studio. 
                <br /><br />
                <em>Code Skeleton in Finder</em>
                <img src="assets/imgs/codeskeletonfinder.png" alt="codeskeletonfinder.png" >
                <br /><br />
                <em> Ask to Copy Folder</em>
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/copyfolder.png" alt="copyfolder.png" >
                <br /><br />
                <em>Code Skeleton in Finder</em>
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/skeletonvscode.png" alt="skeletonvscode.png" >
                <br /><br />
                <strong>NOTE: <em>index</em> has a special meaning in most web servers; if you access a folder without specifying a file, the index page will get loaded. What this means for you, is that when you visit your web site URL, index.html will become the home page.</strong>
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Now that we have setup the technology we will be utilizing, we're going to create a basic "Hello World!" homepage!
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Make sure to save your changes before moving on to the next step; if you have a little blue circle next to the file name, that means it has unsaved changes in it.</strong>
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Follow instructions on Canvas to complete "Hello World" Assignment with the new tags you've been introduced to.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/helloworld.png" alt="helloworld.png">
            </li>
            <li>Now, jump back to Github Desktop. In the app, you should see the new index.html file you added, along with its contents.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/revisedindex.png" alt="revisedindex.png" />
                <br /><br />
                We're going to save a copy of your changes in something called a "commit". <strong>A commit is basically a snapshot of the changes you made, which gets added to the repository's source control.</strong> This is useful for many reasons; for example, if you make a breaking change to your website, you can revert back to a previous commit (aka snapshot) to make it work again while you try to figure out what went wrong.
                <br /><br />
                Add a commit name (required) and description (optional) in the textboxes in the bottom left of the app. Then click the "Commit to main" button to create a commit of your changes.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/commit.png" alt="commit.png">
                <br /><br />
                <strong>WARNING: Github cannot handle super large files, and adding files greater than 20 MB could cause Github Desktop to choke; it is highly recommended to use compressed files on the web anyway, so if you have high resolution image or video files you'd like to use, talk with your instructor first.&nbsp; You will likely make your school life a lot harder otherwise...</strong>
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Next, we are going to do something called a "push". <strong>A push is an action that, well, <em>pushes</em> your local commits to the remote server on github.com.</strong>
                <br /><br />
                There are two places you start a push in Github Desktop, both circled in the screenshot below. (The term <em>origin&nbsp;</em>refers to the repository on the remote server (github.com) that you cloned your local repository from.)
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Note that each location has an indicator of how many commits you are going to push. That is because it's possible to make multiple commits locally before pushing them.</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/pushorigin.png" alt="pushorigin.png" />
                <br /><br />Go ahead and click either option to push your changes to your website.
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>If the push was successful, the top option should change to "Fetch origin".
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/fetchorigin.png" alt="fetchorigin.png" />
                <br /><br />
                For reference:<em>
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>Fetching</em> is a command to tell Github Desktop to communicate with the remote server repository to see if anything changed since the last time we fetched.</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    If there were any changes (which could happen if you were writing code on multiple computers or with a team of developers who were pushing their own commits), that button would change to "Pull origin", and indicate how many commits that you're missing.
                <br /><br />
                <strong><em>Pulling&nbsp;</em>is the process of downloading/syncing changes from the remote server repository with your own local repository.</strong>
                <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Now return to the GitHub website, and go into the repository you made earlier with github.io at the end of it. Once you navigate to the main repository code screen, you should see your HelloWorld folder that you created in the middle section.
                <br><br>
            <strong>NOTE: Github pages often times takes 5-10 minutes to actually render out your commit, so you may have to wait and then check to see if your site is live </strong>
            <br><br>
            Now you can navigate to the sidebar and click on github pages under "Environments". 
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/imgs/githubsidebar.png" alt="githubsidebar.png" />
                <br /><br />
                From there you will find the deployment page (the most recent deployment will usually be at the top). Click on the deployment and it will open your "homepage" of sorts. In order to find your Hello World site (a project nested in your main repository), you must add the project folder name to the end of the URL
                <br /><br />
                For example:
                <br>
                https://gdwd-kc.github.io/kctobias.github.io<strong>/HelloWorld/</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong>Don't forget the last forward slash!</strong>
                <img src="assets/imgs/githubsidebar.png" alt="githubsidebar.png" />
                <br /><br />
                Within a couple minutes of pushing your code, the url should update to display your brand new "Hello World" homepage! 
                <br><br>
           
                <strong>Congratulations! You just built your first GitHub Pages site.</strong>
            </li>
