            <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/</a> and create a GitHub account.&nbsp; <br /><br />NOTE: Your username will be publicly viewable, and will also be included in the URL for your website, so make sure to pick something you're comfortable sharing with the world!<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>Login to your GitHub account.&nbsp; From your home screen, click the green "Create repository" button.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_1.png" alt="A01_Github_1.png" /><br /><br /></li>
            <li>Name your new repository:&nbsp;<em>your_username</em>.github.io&nbsp; (replacing&nbsp;<em>your_username&nbsp;</em>with your actual username, of course)<br /><br />NOTE: This is very important to get right!&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_2_1.png" alt="A01_Github_2_1.png" /><br /><br />
                <p>Make sure it is public, and tell GitHub to create a README file as well.&nbsp; Then click the green "Create repository" button.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_2_2.png" alt="A01_Github_2_2.png" /></p>
            </li>
            <li>Now that you've created the repository, we're going to confirm that Github Pages is working correctly.&nbsp; You should be on the repository page after creating it, so click on the "Settings" tab in the navigation near the top.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_3.png" alt="A01_Github_3.png" /><br /><br /></li>
            <li>From there, click the "Pages" link in the left sidenav.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_4.png" alt="A01_Github_4.png" /><br /><br /></li>
            <li>You should see the link to your brand new website in the green box.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_Github_5.png" alt="A01_Github_5.png" /><br /><br />Congrats!&nbsp; You've created your first website (it's just very empty at the moment).</li>

            <li>
                <p>If you haven't already, download and install GitHub Desktop from the following site: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://desktop.github.com/</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>After installation, log in using your new GitHub account.&nbsp; It will take you briefly back to the browser to confirm your identify; click "Allow" when prompted.&nbsp; You should see some pages in the app like the following: <img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_0_1.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_0_1"  /><br /><br />Here's the page you will see when it redirects you to Github to authenticate yourself.<br /><br />
              <img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_1.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_1.png" /><br /><br />On the Configure Git, select the "Use my Github account name and email address".<br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_1_2.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_1_2.png"  /><br /><br /></li>
            <li>After you've successfully logged in to GitHub Desktop, we are going to "clone" your remote repository to your local machine.&nbsp; What this means is, we are going to pull down and create a copy of the repository from Github.com (the remote location) to your Desktop (the local location).</li>
            <li>Create a new folder on your desktop called "GitHub".</li>
            <li>In GitHub Desktop, click the "Clone a Repository from the Internet" button.<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_1_3.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_1_3.png" /><br /><br /></li>
            <li>Select the Repository we just created earlier on Github.com, and select the folder on your Desktop you just created (you may need to add <em>your_username</em>.github.io to the file path afterwards if it doesn't auto-populate it; see the screenshot below).<br /><br /><img src="../../images/assignments/prompts/A01_GithubDesktop_2.png" alt="A01_GithubDesktop_2.png" /><br /><br /></li>
            <li>After clicking "Clone", Github Desktop will download your repository from the web.&nbsp; After the download, you should see a new folder named after your repository, with a readme file inside it.&nbsp; This means you successfully cloned your repository!</li>
